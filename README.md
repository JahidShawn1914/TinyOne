# TinyOne
This project is a fully responsive website created as a practice exercise. Using HTML, Bootstrap, and a Figma file as the design reference, I built this site to develop skills in responsive design and CSS frameworks.

# Features
 Design: Based on a Figma file for precise layout and visual matching.
 CSS Framework: Utilizes Bootstrap for faster styling, consistent components, and layout flexibility.
 Responsiveness: Adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
# Purpose
This project was created solely for practice, focusing on learning responsive design principles, utilizing Bootstrap components, and translating a static design file into a functional, adaptable website.
